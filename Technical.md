As a general troubleshooting feature, all Thinker builds also include a custom crash handler that
writes output to `debug.txt` in the game folder if the game happens to crash for any reason.


Original game mechanics
=======================

Faction definition files
------------------------
Due to limitations in the savegame format, the faction txt file parser is able to read only up to eight different
special rules with separate parameters for each faction. Any additional parameter-specific rules encountered in
the faction file are simply ignored. All of the rules limited in number are listed below.

* TECH (when used with alphabetic tech keys and not numbers)
* FACILITY
* UNIT
* SOCIAL
* ROBUST
* IMMUNITY
* IMPUNITY
* PENALTY
* FUNGNUTRIENT
* FUNGMINERALS
* FUNGENERGY
* VOTES
* FREEFAC
* REVOLT
* NODRONE
* FREEABIL
* PROBECOST
* DEFENSE
* OFFENSE


Spawning mind worms
-------------------
Whenever an unit not owned by the planet tries to enter a fungus tile that is not occupied by anyone, the game
may decide to randomly spawn mind worms. The base chance this happens is determined by the following formula.
BaseFindDist is the tile distance to the nearest base owned by any faction and MapNativeLifeForms is the
native life option enumerated from 0 to 2. Fungus tiles adjacent to bases, tiles containing magtubes or
amphibious units entering land tiles from sea will never spawn mind worms. If the faction has Xenoempathy Dome,
mind worms are always skipped at least for non-combat units. If the tile has a supply pod, this feature is
skipped since the supply pod may spawn mind worms on adjacent tiles instead.

    Min(32, BaseFindDist) + 10 * MapNativeLifeForms

This base chance is then modified by the following factors.
These calculations are only performed using integers with the numbers truncating towards zero.

* If the destination is ocean divide by 2 (or 4 when rare natives).
* Having a road on the tile divides by 2.
* Native unit entering the tile divides by 2 (predefined prototype with PSI attack).
* If any previous land or sea unit (excluding planet-owned units) has entered the tile divide by 2 (or 4 when rare natives).
* Sensors divide by 4 when on adjacent tiles and by 2 when they are at two tile distance.
* All sensors in the range apply the effect separately. Base tiles count as sensors.
* If the base has GSP, in addition eight tiles near the base tile count as having a sensor.

This chance is then rolled against Random(100). If the chance is equal or less than the random number,
mind worms will not appear. This may always be skipped if the other factors divide the base chance towards zero.


Atrocity details
----------------
The game makes a distinction between major and minor atrocities which have different effects on diplomacy.
Using planet busters is the only thing that counts directly as major atrocity. Minor atrocities are obliterate base,
using nerve gas on non-alien factions, nerve stapling bases, and probe team genetic warfare. If UN Charter is lifted
or there are sunspots in effect, other factions will not learn about committed minor atrocities, with the exception
being that if they are directed against population considered being from another faction, that faction will always
learn about the atrocity and want revenge against the opponent.

Every time a minor atrocity is committed, the game increments the variable for faction minor atrocities and checks
the following condition. Difficulty level is a faction dependent setting enumerated from 0 to 5. As an exception
nerve stapling bases that are assimilated or using nerve gas on non-base tiles will only increase minor atrocities
once regardless of how many times it is committed.

    MinorAtrocities > 4 * (8 - Faction->diff_level)

If this is true, a major atrocity will also be created for the faction which usually carries notable
diplomatic consequences. For player factions on transcend difficulty the threshold is more than 12.


Tech tree visualization
=======================
As an additional feature, this repository includes a script written in Python 3 that can be used to visualize
any custom tech trees defined in alphax.txt. Techs are strictly aligned based on their level in the output
to make it easier to visualize the research order. To use the script, first install dependencies.

    pip install networkx matplotlib

Then plot any possible tech tree defined in alphax.txt to a png file.

    ./tools/techvisual.py -f techs.png /path/to/alphax.txt


Compiling Thinker
=================
Install dependencies to compile Thinker on Windows using CodeBlocks:

* [CodeBlocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/)
* [MinGW toolkit](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases/download/14.2.0-rt_v12-rev1/i686-14.2.0-release-posix-dwarf-msvcrt-rt_v12-rev1.7z)

To avoid compiling issues, do not use the older MinGW toolkit version bundled with CodeBlocks.
GCC versions older than 8.1.0 are not supported. After installing MinGW, new paths need to be
entered in Settings > Compiler > Toolchain Executables for the default GNU GCC Compiler profile.

Another way to build Thinker on Linux platforms is to convert the CodeBlocks project files into
actual Makefiles and then compile them using g++-mingw-w64 (posix threading version required).
A build script that does all these steps is provided in `tools/compile` folder.

1. First install dependencies: `apt install build-essential g++-mingw-w64-i686-posix`
2. Install [cbp2make](https://github.com/mirai-computing/cbp2make) rev156 (other versions not supported) or compile it from sources.
3. Make sure that `cbp2make` binary is included in the environment PATH.
4. Build Thinker: `./tools/compile/mingw-compile.sh`
5. Get compiled binaries from: `build/bin/`


Details for patch startup method
================================
Thinker's launcher program thinker.exe requires the original terranx.exe (game version 2.0) provided
by GOG in the same folder, (3 084 288 bytes, SHA-1 checksum: 4b19c1fe3266b5ebc4305cd182ed6e864e3a1c4a).
Using other official game binaries of the same version should also work. If an incompatible,
modified binary is found, the mod will display an error message and close the game.

Thinker will not modify terranx.exe file on disk, so it can still be used to start an unpatched
version of the game. Instead the mod will apply all of the changes at startup by patching
the binary in memory. Also Scient's patch v2.0 changes are automatically loaded at startup.

Source file `src/patchdata.h` contains Scient's Patch v2.0 changes that are applied at game startup.
Using a separate script this file can be converted into IDA PatchByte commands that can be used to
transform the default terranx.exe into a patched version that will also load thinker.dll at startup.
When the unmodified GOG binary is loaded in IDA, use this script to create the IDA PatchByte commands:

    ./tools/idapatch.py < src/patchdata.h

At game startup, Windows will attempt to load thinker.dll from the same folder before the game starts.
Note that Windows will terminate the process if any of the dll dependencies from the import table
are not available. When thinker.dll is loading, it will attempt to patch the game binary image
residing in the same address space before the actual game can start.

This way it is not required to write any of the actual patches to the exe file, instead they can be
applied dynamically at runtime. Thinker also performs some sanity checks during patching, and it
will close the game process with an error message if any of the checks fail.


Patching OpenSMACX to work with Thinker
=======================================
Due to the simplicity of Thinker's loading method, [OpenSMACX](https://github.com/b-casey/OpenSMACX/)
or the default terranx.exe can be patched manually in a hex editor to also load Thinker at startup.

Note that this combination of patches is not fully tested and some issues may appear due
to the combination of these binaries. After patching, OpenSMACX binary will not start
unless Windows can also load thinker.dll from the same folder.

1. Open `terranx_opensmacx_v0.2.1.exe` (or latest release) in a hex editor.
2. Replace any string `SHELL32.dll` with `thinker.dll`
3. Replace any string `ShellExecuteA` with `ThinkerModule`
4. Move all exe and dll files to the same folder with Alpha Centauri.

Thinker should now start along with OpenSMACX. Thinker version should always be visible in the game
version menu (Ctrl+F4). If this is not the case, Thinker did not start correctly with the game.
Check if you are actually running the game binary with the imports patched as described above.
