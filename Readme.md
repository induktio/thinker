SMACX Thinker Mod
=================

Thinker is an AI improvement mod for Alpha Centauri: Alien Crossfire. By patching the game to use an additional dll, new functionality can be coded in C++, unlike previous patches. Some of the features include:

* New production AI for bases
* Improved terraforming AI (lots of condenser-farms, boreholes and forests)
* AI builds more crawlers and deploys them better
* AI will deploy colony pods much sooner instead of wandering on the map
* Customizable options for free formers and satellites for AI factions
* Does not affect player-run factions or game mechanics
* Game binary includes [Scient's patches](Details.md)

This mod requires the [GOG version](https://www.gog.com/game/sid_meiers_alpha_centauri) of Alpha Centauri to play.
