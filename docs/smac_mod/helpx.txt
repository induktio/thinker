^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>
 
#;Democratic
#HELPSOC02
Democracies allow citizens to participate in government, and forego
oppression and the stability it confers in favor of growth and efficiency.
But citizens remain suspicious of large military deployments, and civilian
oversight creates large military bureaucracies, so military support
costs increase.

#HELPSOC03
Fundamentalist politics unite a society behind a strong, dogmatic

#HELPSOC11
Free Market Economics turns market forces loose in your society.
Unfettered market economics can produce great wealth quickly, but

The {Colony Module} can be used to create custom $LINK<Colony Pods=30000>.
Units with Colony Modules can build new bases. If a Colony Module
is installed on a sea-going unit, bases can be constructed at sea.
^
A Colony Module also costs one population of the base it is built from 
in addition to the minerals listed. If this would cause a base to have 0 population, 
you are given the choice to disband the base or wait until it has reached 2 population.
^
Colony Modules can be added to an existing base to increase the base
population by 1 using the Join Base command {B}. This operation can be
used to increase the size of the base beyond the limits imposed by lack
of $LINK<Hab Complexes=100024> and $LINK<Habitation Domes=100025>.

The {Troop Transport} module allows a unit to transport other units
by land, sea, or air, depending on the unit's chassis.
^
Only sea-going units can transport more than one unit at a time.
A {Foil} can transport a number of units equal to twice its reactor
value. A {Cruiser} can transport a number of units equal to four
times its reactor value.
^
Transports can normally transport only ground units, but seagoing
transports can be given the $LINK<Carrier Deck=80007> special ability to
allow them to transport and refuel air units.
^
Additionally, air transports can only load and unload passengers in a base or
airbase. However, choosing the unload transport {Shift+U} command will allow
the passengers to unload while the air transport is in flight.

The {Supply Transport} module can be used to create custom supply
units. Such units function much as $LINK<Supply Crawlers=30005>, and can:
^
* Produce nutrients, minerals, or energy from any square on the map
and send the resources to its home base.
Select the "Convoy" ('O') option on the Action Menu.
^ Convoy resources receive the benefits of facilities 
and secret projects in their home base that increase the resources collected.
^
* Disband themselves in a friendly base to yield their {full} mineral
value towards the construction of a secret project or unit prototype.
^
Any unit with the Supply Transport module has no supply cost.

Any unit with the Probe Team module has no supply cost. 
The addition of the $LINK<Clean=80016> ability would be redundant.
^
 
{Probe Teams} can infiltrate and subvert enemy bases and units. They can
also steal enemy research information energy credits, sabotage base facilities,
assassinate key enemy personnel to slow research, free captured faction leaders
from headquarters, and conduct genetic warfare.
^
Move a probe team up to an enemy base or single unit to engage its powers.
^
Probe teams can ignore any $LINK<zone of control=34>.
^
Probe teams can also defend your bases against their enemy counterparts.
If a probe team is present in a square when an enemy probe team tries
to enter, a combat is resolved between them. The probe team with the
highest $LINK<morale=11> level usually wins.
^
Probe teams often receive morale increases when they complete missions
successfully. The higher a probe team's morale level, the more likely
it is to survive more risky missions.

^
Ground or Naval units with air superiority do not gain the 100% bonus vs air, 
but they do not get the 50% penalty vs other ground or naval units either.

Air-to-air combat is resolved by comparing attack factors--the armor
value is ignored.

Note that even ground and naval units can be equipped with the SAM
missiles necessary to confer this ability.

radius of a missile's target, then a missile has only a 25% chance of success. 
 
#; Subspace Generator
#HELPFAC40
This is the main component of the Resonance Communicator used by $LINK<Progenitor=47> 
factions to broadcast Planet's location to their respective forces. Once a Progenitor 
faction constructs six Generators in bases of size 10 or higher, the Communicator calls a fleet 
of reinforcements, thereby ending human habitation on Planet with 
a $LINK<Progenitor Victory=10014>.
 
#; Geosynchronous Survey Pod
#HELPFAC41
This base's sighting radius increases to three squares. The pod also acts as 
a $LINK<sensor array=90009>, conferring a +25% defensive bonus. Geosynchronous Pods may 
be destroyed by $LINK<Orbital Defense Pods=100068> or $LINK<Probe Teams=30006>.
 
#; The Manifold Harmonics
#HELPPROJ33

Units equipped with {Soporific Gas Pods} reduce enemy $LINK<morale=11> by 2 when attacking.
^This does not work against native lifeforms
 
#ABILDESC25
Units equipped with a {Dissociative Wave} can counter special abilities that modify
combat percentages. This nullifies specials such as the $LINK<Comm Jammer=80009> 
and $LINK<Hypnotic Trance=80018>.
 
#ABILDESC26
Sea units equipped with a {Marine Detachment} can board and capture enemy ships that 
have been severely damaged.

#ABILDESC28
$LINK<Probe Teams=30006> equipped with {Algorithmic Enhancement} perform covert operations 
with greater chances of success. Enhanced Probe Teams can also infiltrate bases and units 
regardless of social engineering choices or $LINK<The Hunter-Seeker Algorithm=110085> Secret 
Project, although they still have a high rate of failure.
 
#UNITDESC14
{Sealurks} haunt the fungal patches and ocean depths of Planet's seas. As opposed to the
less aggressive $LINK<Isles of the Deep=30009>, the Sealurks seek out and attack
ocean and coastal bases. They may also lie in wait for 
easy prey, catching unwary ships that travel too close to $LINK<fungus=14>. When immobile,
these creatures are extremely hard to detect until they begin their attack.
^
Sealurks can engage in $LINK<Psi Combat=15> when attacked,
in which weapon and armor strengths are ignored.
$LINK<Morale=11> level is quite important when attacking Sealurks.
^
With proper breeding and bonding techniques, Sealurks can
also be bred in captivity and controlled by skilled brood trainers.
Like any native unit, players can also release Sealurks into the wild, to harass and
disrupt an enemy.
^
Native lifeforms stationed in xenofungus do not require $LINK<support=130002>.
^
Wild native lifeforms outside bases fight at reduced strength before 2115.
^Wild native lifeforms, when attacking bases, fight at reduced strength until 2150.
 
#UNITDESC15
{Spore Launchers} can appear singly or in the company of $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>, 
and are closely associated with $LINK<fungus=14>. Spore Launchers tend to lurk
on the outskirts of a settlement, expelling bursts of corrosive spores that can 
destroy man-made or Progenitor improvements from a range of two squares away. These 
spores are also effective against units.
^
Spore Launchers can engage in $LINK<Psi Combat=15> when attacked,
in which weapon and armor strengths are ignored.
$LINK<Morale=11> level is quite important when attacking Spore Launchers.
^
With proper breeding and bonding techniques, Spore Launchers can
also be bred in captivity and controlled by skilled brood trainers.
These captive boils can be used as artillery to attack enemy units or terrain improvements.
Like any native unit, players can also release Spore Launchers into the wild, to harass and
disrupt an enemy.
^
Native lifeforms stationed in xenofungus do not require $LINK<support=130002>.

^Wild native lifeforms, when attacking bases, fight at reduced strength until 2150.
 
#UNITDESC16
{Battle Ogres} are rare, mechanical remnants of the first $LINK<Progenitor=47> era on Planet. 
Several different types of Ogres may be found, each with advanced equipment and 
powers. Unfortunately, the convoluted engineering of these units makes it impossible 
for them to be repaired even by Progenitor technicians; any damage taken is permanent.
^
The Battle Ogre Mk1 possesses a $LINK<Resonance Laser=60012>, $LINK<Resonance 3 Armor=70011>, and 
a $LINK<Fission Reactor=50001>. Its awesome size and fearsome appearance also help quell 
drone activity, effectively doubling the $LINK<police=130005> powers of the Ogre.

Progenitors also built the Ogre with the $LINK<Dissociative Wave=80025> special ability.
 
#UNITDESC19
{Fungal Towers} act as a localized nervous system for $LINK<fungus=14> patches.
These Towers are massive, jumbled tangles of Mind Worms, fungus, and other strange native
life forms. Although the Towers cannot move or attack, they block movement through their
terrain and exert a $LINK<zone of control=34> that can impede units in the area. 
^
When attacked, the Fungal Towers engage in $LINK<Psi Combat=15>,
in which weapon and armor strengths are ignored.
$LINK<Morale=11> level is quite important when attacking Fungal Towers. When attacked, Fungal
Towers receive a 50% bonus due to their ability to co-ordinate and direct native life forms in the area.
^
The size and power of Fungal Towers depends on the amount of fungus adjacent to the Tower.
Towers can also generate fungus in nearby empty squares.
^
Wild native lifeforms outside bases fight at reduced strength before 2115.
 
#UNITDESC20
The U.N.S. Unity contained a few of these lasers, intended for rudimentary mining 
operations. One or two might have survived the Unity's descent onto the surface of Planet. 
In the first few years following Planetfall, these can be used as weapons in a pinch.
 
#WEAPONDESC12
The {Resonance Laser} functions both as a laser and a powerful disruptive force on 
local resonance fields. Its base attack factor is 6, and it receives a +25% bonus 
when engaging in a $LINK<Psi Attack=15>.
^
A unit's {weapon} strength determines its combat strength it attacks.
The more powerful the weapon the stronger the attack.
 
#WEAPONDESC13
The {Resonance Bolt} functions both as a $LINK<Tachyon Bolt=60007> and a powerful 
disruptive force on local resonance fields. Its base attack factor is 12, and it 
receives a +25% bonus when engaging in a $LINK<Psi Attack=15>.
^

#WEAPONDESC24
The {Tectonic Payload} weapons package can be used to create
Tectonic Missiles. It can be used only with the $LINK<Missile=40008>
chassis.
^
A Tectonic Missile detonation causes an earthquake that raises the target terrain by 1-4
level of altitude, depending on the $LINK<reactor=50001> type. A Fission reactor raises the terrain one level, 
a Singularity reactor up to four levels. Tectonic missiles are considered 
delivery platforms instead of combat units, and so may not target bases or units.
 
#WEAPONDESC25
The {Fungal Payload} weapons package can be used to create
Fungal Missiles. It can be used only with the $LINK<Missile=40008>
chassis.
^
A Fungal Missile detonation destroys any improvements in the square. Additionally, the
detonation covers 1-4 squares of terrain with fungus, depending on the $LINK<reactor=50001> type. A Fission
reactor covers one square, a Singularity reactor four squares. The detonation may also trigger
native life forms from dormant spores. Fungal Missiles are considered 
delivery platforms instead of combat units, and so may not target bases or units.
 
#ARMORDESC9
{Psi Defense} armor confers the same defensive ability possessed by native units 
such as $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>. A unit equipped with Psi Defense engages in $LINK<Psi Combat=15>
when attacked, in which weapon and armor strengths are ignored, and the attacker
is given a 3 to 2 advantage on land. $LINK<Morale=11> level is quite important when
attacking a unit equipped with Psi Defense.
