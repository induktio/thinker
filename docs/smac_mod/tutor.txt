#LANDFALL
#xs 300
#button TOUR
Your colony pod has crash landed on Alpha Centauri; its stores have
been used to found your first base, $BASENAME0. You can use the $UNITNAME1
unit which is now active to explore the surrounding area. It can
also be used for defense if necessary.
^
If this is your first time playing Alpha Centauri and you would like
a tour of the interface, click the {TOUR} button.

#TOUR1
#xs 300
A unit's status box blinks when it is ready to move. Use this {$UNITNAME0} to
explore.

#TOUR1A
#xs 300
A unit's status box blinks when it is ready to move. Use this {$UNITNAME0} to
explore.

#TOUR1B
#xs 400
When it is your turn, your game pieces, called 'units', will blink their status box
to let you know that you can move them. When no status boxes are blinking,
a cursor will flash instead; in this case, you can switch back to
moving pieces by pressing the 'V' key (don't do it now, wait until
the tour is complete).

#TOUR2
#xs 300
You can use the "arrow keys" or the mouse to move units.
The SPACE bar tells a unit to stay where it is for now.

#TOUROCEAN
#xs 300
Only naval and air units can enter ocean squares.

#TOUROCEAN2
#xs 300
Your $UNITTYPE0 unit can explore the ocean and transport
your ground units to other continents.

#TOURFUNGUS
#xs 300
{Xenofungus} is a form of plant life native to Alpha Centauri. For
now, think of it as a dangerous obstacle.

#TOURMAP
#xs 300
Planet's three primary resources are {NUTRIENTS}, {MINERALS}, and {ENERGY}.
To produce these resources, you will wish to find squares with,
respectively, {RAINFALL}, {ROCKINESS}, and high {ALTITUDE}.

#TOURRAIN
#xs 300
The more "green" in a square, the higher the {rainfall}. Rainy squares
produce the most {NUTRIENTS}. {Nutrients} feed your colonists and help
your settlement to grow.

#TOURRAINWET
#xs 300
This green and {RAINY} square is excellent for growing NUTRIENT crops.

#TOURRAINMOD
#xs 300
This square receives {MODERATE RAINFALL}, as indicated by the modest
amounts of green, and will support crops. Planting a farm here
will improve {NUTRIENT} production considerably.

#TOURRAINDRY
#xs 300
This dry, {ARID} terrain (no green) will not produce nutrients
without considerable terraforming or forestation. Remember, when
you want to grow crops, look for {green} squares.

#TOURRAINDRY2
#xs 300
All of the squares nearby are {ARID}, as indicated by the absence
of green patches. Nutrient production in arid squares is poor, so
you will need to plant {FARMS} or {FORESTS} quickly.

#TOURALT
#xs 300
These two squares lie at different {ALTITUDES}. The higher a square,
the more {ENERGY} it will produce if you build a solar collector.
As a rule of thumb, each 1000 meters of altitude increases your
ENERGY yield by one.

#TOURTWOFOOD
#xs 300
This would be a good place to plant a farm. FARMS increase the
{NUTRIENTS} which can be produced in a square.

#TOURTWOROCK
#xs 300
This square is quite {ROCKY}, and is excellent for producing {MINERALS}.
Your bases need minerals to build new units and facilities. Crops do not
grow well in rocky squares.

#TOURONEROCK
#xs 300
This square is {ROLLING} terrain (some rocks), and will produce
some {MINERALS}.

#TOURFLAT
#xs 300
This square is {FLAT} (no rocks), and will not produce any
{MINERALS} unless you build a {MINE} or plant a {FOREST}.

#TOURFOREST
#xs 400
In each square, your Formers can build {FARMS}, which improve
{nutrient} production, {MINES}, which improve {mineral} production,
and {SOLAR COLLECTORS}, which improve {energy} production. They
can also plant {FORESTS} for balanced resource production and build
{ROADS} to speed movement.

#TOURREVIEW
#xs 440
A quick review of basic resource production:
^{NUTRIENTS} are best produced in {WET} areas (Plant {FARMS}).
^{MINERALS} are best produced in {ROCKY} areas (Build {MINES}).
^{ENERGY} is best produced in {HIGH} areas (Build {SOLAR COLLECTORS}).
^{FORESTS} produce a fixed amount of all resource types.
Finally, if an area is very rocky, nutrient production is penalized.

#TOURADVANCED
#xs 440
Advanced players may be interested in these later options:
^{CONDENSERS} increase rainfall in every surrounding square.
^{BOREHOLES} provide massive quantities of MINERALS and ENERGY.
^{AQUIFERS} release underground rivers.
^{MAG TUBES} vastly increase movement rates.
^{SOIL ENRICHERS} further improve farm output.
^{LEVEL TERRAIN} decreases rockiness.
^{RAISE/LOWER TERRAIN} can change continents and affect weather patterns.

#TOURFORMDONE
#xs 440
So, to wrap up our tour of terraforming functions, we'll suggest
that you begin planting farms and forests in squares near your
base (move your Formers to those squares, then press the 'F' or
'Shift+F' key). We'll give you more hints as you go along.
^
If you wish to take this tour again, select "Terraforming Tour" from
the "Help" menu.

#TOURSCAN
#xs 300
The {Planetary Scan} shows a zoomed out view of the planet which you
can use to find your way around.

#TOURMENU
#xs 300
The {Main Menu} is summoned by clicking this button; it works much
like your Windows START button.
^
Advanced players may wish to switch to "Detailed Menus" from the
game menu.

#TOURCOMMLINK
#xs 300
The {Commlink} button allows you to contact other factions; you can
click on the name of any faction you've met to open negotiations.
In a multiplayer game this window also shows the chat status and
current turn clock.

#TOURUNITSINFO
#xs 300
The {Unit Window} shows you which unit you are moving right now, or
which unit you currently have selected.

#TOURTERRAININFO
#xs 300
The {Terrain Window} details the terrain at your current location.
The rainier (greener) an area is, the more NUTRIENTS it produces. The
rockier an area, the more MINERALS it makes; and the higher an area, the
more ENERGY can be produced.

#TOURSTACKINFO
#xs 300
The {Stack Window} allows you to see all of the units in the current
square. Click on any unit here to select it. Note that a unit's
"stats" e.g. 1-1-1 indicate its {weapon,} {armor,} and {moves.}
Better units have higher values.

#TOURMESSAGEINFO
#xs 300
The {Message Window} provides useful data of many types throughout
the game. You can click here to cycle through the different displays,
or to hold on a display which you wish to study in detail.

#TOURBUTTONINFO
#xs 300
The {Info Button} causes the Message Window to cycle through
general information.

#TOURBUTTONMESSAGE
#xs 300
The {Message Button} causes the Message Window to list events
which have occurred at your bases recently (such as new items
built, drone riots, etc). You can click on listed items to zoom
to the affected base.

#TOURWORLDINFO
#xs 300
The {World Window} shows an overhead map of the whole planet. You
may click anywhere on the map to cause the view to zoom to that
location.

#TOURDATEINFO
#xs 300
The current date and your energy reserves are shown here.

#TOURBUTTONTURN
#xs 300
You can click the {Turn Button} to proceed to the next turn. Normally
the game will proceed to the next turn automatically once you've moved
all of your units. This button is more important in multiplayer games.

#TOURINFO
#xs 300
The {Data Readout} displays valuable information about your current
situation. You can click in the data readout to cycle through the
displays manually.

#TOURSTAT
#xs 300
The {Mission Status} display lists the contents of the active square
on the main map; here is where you'll find details on units, bases,
and terrain in the current square.

#TOUROVER
#xs 440
So, your first job is to use your Scout Patrol to explore the
area around your base.
^
If you wish to take this tour again, select "Interface Tour" from
the "Help" menu.

#BASECONTROL
#xs 400
#button TOUR
The {Base Control Screen} allows you to control the production
and economic growth of your base, $BASENAME0. Click the {TOUR}
button for more details.

#TOUR1GOVERNOR
#xs 400
We'll begin the Base tour by introducing you to the {Governor}.
The Governor is a valuable assistant who can help you control
the activities of your base. Whether beginner or expert, you will
find the Governor can help you get your bases up and running quickly.
To use the Governor, simply tell him whether this base should
{Explore, Discover, Build,} or {Conquer.}

#TOUR1EXPLORE
#xs 400
The {EXPLORE} button tells the Governor to concentrate on
finding and occupying new territory. Bases set to explore
will typically concentrate on building {Scouts,} {Colony Pods,}
{Transports,} and occasional {Naval Units} for scouting oceans.
This button is especially useful early in the game, when
you need to expand quickly.

#TOUR1DISCOVER
#xs 400
The {DISCOVER} button emphasizes scientific discovery and
technological breakthroughs. The Governor will concentrate on
building {Science Facilities} (such as Network Nodes), {Secret
Projects,} {Probe Teams,} and {Prototype Units.} This button
is especially effective with large, well-protected bases deep
in your interior.

#TOUR1BUILD
#xs 400
The {BUILD} button mandates infrastructure and growth. The Governor
will tend to build {Facilities} and {Formers}. Use this button at
any time to have your base concentrate on peaceful growth.

#TOUR1CONQUER
#xs 440
Use the {CONQUER} button to build up your military. In this mode
your base will produce {military units} of all varieties,
and their associated facilities, such as {Command Centers.}
Use this button whenever you need to attack or defend.

#TOUR1GOVERNOR2
#xs 440
You now have enough information to get started; if you wish, click
the {End Tour} button and begin playing. Or, keep reading to learn
how you can manage a base yourself.
^
We'll begin with the {GOVERNOR} button proper, which can be used to
turn the Governor off and on. Note that clicking on the Explore,
Discover, Build, or Conquer button automatically turns the Governor
on.

#TOUR1ADVANCED
The {ADVANCED GOVERNOR} button brings up a dialog box which allows
you to customize your Governor. For instance, you could tell your Governor
to build {only} facilities.

#TOUR1CAPTION
#xs 300
The {Information Box} shows the name of the base.

#TOUR1ECO
#xs 300
For convenience, the date and your current {Energy Reserves} shown
here. If your base has grown large enough to pose a danger to the
local environment, the {Ecological Damage} indicator shows the
percentage chance of intervention by Planet.

#TOUR1POP
#xs 300
The {Population Bar} shows you the citizens of $BASENAME0--each
"person" represents about 1,000 colonists. Most of your citizens
will be grey {Workers}, capable of producing standard resources.
Later, you may elevate some citizens to become {Specialists} (Doctors,
Technicians, Librarians, etc).

#TOUR1POP2
#xs 300
Good social conditions in your colony may cause some Workers to become
green {Talents}. Poor social conditions and overcrowding will
turn them into red {Drones}. Whenever your base has more
drones than talents, there will be a {Drone Riot}. To correct
this problem, build a psych-related base facility such as a
{Recreation Dome}, convert some citizens into {Doctors}, or increase
your energy allocation to {Psych}.

#TOUR1STAPLE
#xs 300
The {Nerve Staple} button is a particularly draconian means of
controlling drone riots. If you Nerve Staple your citizens, they will
cease rioting for at least {ten turns}. Do this only in an emergency,
however, because Nerve Stapling is considered an {atrocity}.

#TOUR1PRODUCTION
#xs 300
The {Production Box} shows what the base is currently making. Bases
can produce new units or build facilities to improve the base
itself. Your base uses {minerals} to produce things. When all of the
mineral icons in the box light up, your new unit or facility will be
ready.

#TOUR1QUEUE
#xs 300
The {Build Queue} shows what this base will build next, after it
finished its current production.

#TOUR1CHANGE
#xs 300
Click on the {Change Button} to set new production orders for your
base.

#TOUR1HURRY
#xs 300
Use the {Hurry Button} if you need to finish something fast. You can
spend your {Energy Reserves} to complete production quickly, but it
can get expensive.

#TOUR1GARRISON
#xs 400
The {Garrison Box} shows you what units are currently present at this
base--try to keep at least one military unit in each base to guard
it from unexpected attack. You may click on any unit to activate it,
or right-click for additional options.

#TOUR1SUPPORTED
#xs 400
The {Forces Supported Box} shows the units which this base has
produced (and which it therefore must {support}). These units are
not necessarily present at the base right now--you can use the
{SUPPORT} button to find out where they are.

#TOUR1FACILITIES
#xs 400
The {Facilities Box} shows any {facilities} you have built at this
base. Facilities increase the potential of your base (for instance,
a Network Node increases your labs output), but most facilities
require a small amount of energy each turn for {maintenance}. If you
no longer want one of your facilities, you can click on it to
{scrap and recycle} it.

#TOUR1COMMERCE
#xs 400
The {Commerce Box} shows your trade with other factions. If you sign
a {Treaty} or {Pact} with another faction, your base will automatically
begin commerce with your new friends, resulting in {extra energy} for
your base. Commerce rates are affected
by (1) the size of the bases involved, (2) the number of economic
techs you have discovered, and (3) whether you have a Treaty or
Pact (with a Pact you gain double commerce).

#TOUR1NUTRIENTS
#xs 400
The {Nutrients Box} shows your base's potential for {growth}. As your
base produces {nutrients,} they are collected here; when all of the
nutrient boxes light up, your base will increase in population.

#TOUR1AREA
#xs 400
The {Base Map} shows the region around your base. Any square in this
region can be farmed, mined, or otherwise improved by your citizens
in order to produce {nutrients}, {minerals}, and {energy}, which are
the basic economic units of the game. Squares in use are marked with
icons showing the quantity of each resource they are producing.
^
You can utilize one square on this map for each {Worker} you have
at this base (you can also always utilize the base square itself).
You can drag Workers from square to square, or drag them into the
{Population Bar} to elevate them to {specialists.}
^
You cannot utilize unexplored squares, squares utilized by other
nearby bases, or squares occupied by enemy units.

#TOUR1NUT
#xs 400
The {Nutrient Bar} shows your current nutrient production. Nutrients
feed your citizens and help your colony to grow. Each citizen needs
$NUM0 nutrients each turn to live; this {consumption} is shown on the left side
of the bar. Any {surplus} nutrient production is shown on the right
side of the bar. The surplus, if any, is stored each turn for possible
future use and {population growth}. Any items appearing in red
represent a {shortfall} and can lead to {starvation.}
^
If you need to improve nutrient production, move citizens on the area
map to squares which produce more nutrients. Send your {Former}
units (on the main map) to build {Farms} in these squares.

#TOUR1MIN
#xs 400
The {Minerals Bar} shows your current mineral production. Depending
on the number of military units you have built (and your social
engineering settings), you may have to expend some minerals each turn
to {support} existing units. This is shown at the left of the bar.
Any {surplus} minerals are shown at the right of the bar; they are
applied to your current {production}. Any items appearing in red
constitute a support {shortfall} and can lead to the elimination of
unsupported military units.
^
If your base needs more minerals, send your {Former} units to build
more {Mines.}

#TOUR1ENERGY
#xs 400
The {Energy Bar} diagrams the current energy output of $BASENAME0.
Any red tiles represent energy lost to {Inefficiency}.
Inefficiency increases when your social engineering choices are
inadequate to the needs of a large colony and population. If you are
losing a lot of energy to inefficiency, consider building a
{Children's Creche} to increase efficiency or switching to a more
economically efficient social model (Democratic or Green, for
instance).
^
If your base needs more energy, send your {Former} units to build
more {Solar Collectors.}

#TOUR1ALLOC
#xs 400
The {Energy Allocation Chart} shows how your energy output is being
allocated amongst your three priorities: {Economy,} {Labs,}
and {Psych.}
^
You can reallocate your energy at any time by selecting
{Social Engineering} from the HQ Menu.

#TOUR1ALLOC2
#xs 400
The {Energy Allocation Button} allows you to see how your energy
output is being allocated among your three priorities: {Economy,}
{Labs,} and {Psych.}
^
You can reallocated your energy at any time by selecting
{Social Engineering} from the HQ Menu.

#TOUR1ECON
#xs 400
Energy allocated to {economy} is used to
increase your {energy reserves}, which you can later spend to
hurry production, bribe neighbors, and maintain base facilities.

#TOUR1PSYCH
#xs 400
Energy allocated to {psych} is used to improve the quality of life
for your citizens. Every two units of energy spent here stimulates
one worker to become a {Talent}. Spending here will help to prevent
{drone riots}.

#TOUR1LABS
#xs 400
Energy allocated to {labs} is used for scientific research; the
more you spend here the faster you will discover new technologies.

#TOUR1SUPPORTBUTTON
#xs 300
The {Support Button} switches the Base Map to a broad view which
shows where the units produced by (and therefore supported by) this
base have moved. The large colored icon represents your base; smaller
icons represent this base's units.

#TOUR1PSYCHBUTTON
#xs 300
The {Psych Button} switches the Base Map to a psych profile. The
information here may help you to alleviate poor living conditions
and prevent {drone riots}.

#TOUR1RESOURCEBUTTON
#xs 300
The {Resource Button} returns the Base Map to the standard
resource view; this is the view you will generally find most
helpful in managing your base.

#TOUR1PREV
#xs 300
When you have more than one base, the {Previous Base Button} zooms
to the base just before this one in alphabetical order.

#TOUR1NEXT
#xs 300
Similarly, the {Next Base Button} zooms to the base just after this
one in alphabetical order.

#TOUR1RENAME
#xs 300
The {Rename Button} allows you to rename your base. Renaming a base
you've captured from another player may goad him to anger.

#TOUR1OK
#xs 300
Finally, the {OK Button} allows you to close the Base Control Screen
when you are done with it. You can also press the ENTER key
to close the window.
^
This tour contains many details that you may wish to review later.
You can take this tour again at any time by selecting {Base Tour}
from the Help Menu.

#DESWIN
#xs 400
#button TOUR
On the {Design Workshop Screen}, you create new units with which
to explore and conquer Planet. You assign each unit type a weapon,
armor, chassis, reactor, and perhaps a special ability or two. You
are then free to begin building those units at any of your bases.
^
If you would like a more detailed tour of this screen, click the
{TOUR} button

#DESTOURCHAS
#xs 400
The {Chassis} determines the number of {moves} a unit gets each
turn. You can also choose a {land,} {sea,} or {air} chassis. Certain
chassis gain special combat bonuses; for instance the Infantry chassis
type is especially good for attacking enemy bases.

#DESTOURWEAP
#xs 400
Assigning your unit a {Weapon} allows it to attack enemy units. The
higher the attack value the more likely your chances for success (but
the more costly the unit will be to build). You can also choose
{Equipment} modules to create units for noncombat roles.

#DESTOURARM
#xs 400
{Armor} protects your unit from attack. The thicker the better.

#DESTOURREACTOR
#xs 400
A {Reactor} provides power to your unit. You should usually select
the biggest reactor allowed by your technology level, since this
not only makes your unit harder to kill, it often lowers the cost.

#DESTOURABILITY
#xs 400
When your technology allows, you may add {special abilities}
such as Drop Pods or Antigravity Struts to create units for
specialty missions.

#DESTOURCOST
#xs 400
The {cost} shows the number of minerals which will be required to
build your new unit. Unless you are playing the Spartans, the first
unit of a new type will incur the {prototype cost,} representing the
difficulty of developing new designs.

#DESTOURSTATS
#xs 400
Your unit's {"stats"} are summarized here. The first number represents
weapon strength, or offensive capability. The middle number indicates
armor thickness, or defensive capability. The final number shows the
number of moves. If you have selected a reactor with a value greater
than 1, it will be shown at the end after a star (*).

#DESTOURBAR
#xs 400
Basic unit types and unit types which you have designed will appear
here. You may click on any unit type to examine or edit it.

#DESTOURARROWS
#xs 400
These arrow buttons allow you to scroll through your unit types.

#DESTOURPRESETS
#xs 400
The {Preset} buttons allow you to design certain styles of unit
quickly. Click on any button and the Workshop will propose a design
of that type.

#DESTOURDONE
#xs 400
When you have designed a new unit, or made changes to an old design,
use the {Done} button to confirm your changes and close the design
workshop.

#DESTOURAPPLY
#xs 400
The {Apply} button can be used to confirm your changes without closing
the design workshop; you are then free to create or examine other
unit types.

#DESTOURRENAME
#xs 400
The {Rename} button allows you to name your unit types.

#DESTOUROBS
#xs 400
The {Obsolete} button can be used to mark a unit type as obsolete and
no longer necessary. Obsolete unit types will not show up as production
choices, so they won't clutter up your production menus, but any existing
units of an obsolete type will continue to function until you upgrade
them or they are destroyed or disbanded. You can also use this button
to return a previously obsolete type to service.

#DESTOURUPGRADE
#xs 400
The {Upgrade} button upgrades all units of your currently selected
type to a better type. The Design Workshop will check to see if you
have a better type available and if so will offer you an upgrade.
You must prototype a new unit type before you can upgrade to it.

#DESTOURRETIRE
#xs 400
The {Retire} button retires a unit type from service entirely. Any
remaining units of that type are disbanded, and the design is deleted
from your units list (its "slot" becomes empty).

#DESTOURCANCEL
#xs 400
Finally, the {Cancel} button allows you to leave the Design Workshop
without making any further changes. If you wish to take this tour
again, you may do so at any time by selecting "Design Workshop Tour"
from the Help Menu.

#SOCWIN
#xs 400
#button TOUR
On the {Social Engineering Screen} you expound your vision of
future utopia. The choices you make here have wide-ranging effects

in a particular area--but beware of the weaknesses you may create.
^
If you would like a more detailed tour of this screen, click
the {TOUR} button.

#SOCTOURMAIN
#xs 400
In the {Engineering Box} you make the value choices that will shape
your society. Your choices fall into four categories: {Politics,}
{Economics,} {Values,} and {Future Society.} At the beginning of
the game you have few options; as your researchers make new
breakthroughs in society-related technologies, your options will
grow. You can click on any button in the box to make that society
choice for your colony.

#SOCTOURFACTION
#xs 300
Your {Faction Bonuses} and {Penalties} are shown here. These represent

{ECONOMY} shows the raw strength of your society's economy.
Increasing this value will increase your energy flow.

#SOCTOUR1
#xs 300
{EFFICIENCY} represents your society's ability to function without
waste and mismanagement. If this value falls too low, your bases
will begin to lose energy to inefficiency.

#SOCTOUR2
#xs 300
{SUPPORT} affects the support costs of military units. The lower
your score here, the more of your units you'll have to expend minerals to
support.

#SOCTOUR3
#xs 300
{MORALE} affects the training and determination of your military.
A higher score here translates directly into morale upgrades for your
units.

#SOCTOUR4
#xs 300
{POLICE} shows your society's tolerance for police control and
restrictions on personal freedom. A high score allows you to use
military units as police to suppress drone riots. A low score will
cause increasing tension when your military units are away from home.

#SOCTOUR5
#xs 300
{GROWTH} affects your population growth rate. The higher your score,
the fewer nutrients your bases will need to grow.

#SOCTOUR6
#xs 300
{PLANET} shows your society's sensitivity to the ecology of Planet.
A low score indicates that ecological damage will occur more quickly.

#SOCTOUR7
#xs 300
{PROBE} affects your vulnerability (or strength) on security issues.
A high score will help prevent enemy probe team attacks.

#SOCTOUR8
#xs 300
{INDUSTRY} shows your manufacturing strength. A high score reduces the

society, thereby preventing {Drone Riots.}

#SOCTOURLABS
#xs 400
The {Labs Bar} controls the percentage of your energy flow directed
toward research. Although you can increase your breakthrough rate
by raising this value, it is important to note that your efficiency is
highest when your {Labs} and {Economy} percentages are equal. When
these two settings differ, your inefficiency will increase; the rate
will depend on your {EFFICIENCY} score.

#SOCTOURINFO
#xs 400
The {Info Box} shows additional results of your social choices.
Your technological {Breakthrough Rate} and your per-turn {Energy
Income} are shown here. If your {Labs} and {Economy} settings are

#DRONETOUR1
#xs 400
{Drone Riots} occur when the number of red {Drones} at a base exceeds the
number of green {Talents}. Other citizens, such as {Workers} and
{Specialists} do not directly affect riots. Drones appear as the
result of population pressure and cramped living conditions.
We will show you several means of controlling drone riots.

#DRONETOUR2
#xs 400
One direct method of controlling drone riots is to use military units
as {police}. Military units will automatically function as police if
you move them into your base. The number of police units you will be
able to use depends on your society's tolerance for police, as
represented by your {POLICE} rating on the Social Engineering screen.
By changing your society to a {Police State}, for instance, you will
enable more military units to work as police and suppress riots.

#DRONETOUR3
#xs 400
One particularly draconian means of controlling drone riots is to
{nerve staple} your citizens. Nerve stapling will prevent drone riots
for at least ten turns, but it is considered an atrocity.

#DRONETOUR4
#xs 400
A more humanitarian way to prevent drone riots is to build {facilities}
which alleviate cramped and depressing living conditions. For instance,
a {Recreation Commons} will satisfy the complaints of up to two
Drones, turning them into regular Workers. Building facilities is
an excellent long-term solution to drone problems.

#DRONETOUR5
#xs 400
Creating {Doctors} (or later, {Telepaths} and {Transcendi}) is
another, albeit short-term solution to the problem. Doctors, by
increasing your {Psych} output, will create more Talents to balance
the Drones. To change a citizen into a Doctor, click on him here
in the population bar.

#DRONETOUR6
#xs 400
If you have many large bases producing a great deal of energy, you
can divert some of your energy to {Psych}, which will improve your
citizens' quality of life. Every two units of energy diverted to
Psych turns one of your Workers into a Talent. To divert a percentage
of your energy production to Psych, go to the Social Engineering
screen by selecting it from the HQ menu on the main display.

#caption Some General Hints
Units with thick {armor} and high defensive ratings are useful for
defending important areas; use the 'H' or "Hold" command to entrench
them in your your bases.
^
Fast-moving {Speeder} units are excellent for exploration and mobile
attack. Use them to explore the planet and search for enemies.
^
Should you decide to attack an enemy, design a unit with a powerful
{weapon} and perhaps good armor or a high movement rate.
^
{Colony Pods} allow your colony to spread by building
new bases. The more bases you build, the faster your colony will grow.
^
{Former} units will speed the process of building farms
and roads as well as other infrastructure. Don't neglect to build
Formers once your colony begins to expand.

#NEWCOLONIST

the fields in which they study.

#TERRAFORM
#xs 400
Events which cause {mountains} to be raised or torn down (earthquakes,
the actions of Former units, etc.) can also cause {climactic
changes}. Mountains 2000m above sea level and higher significantly
affect cloud formation and rainfall by trapping the moisture being
carried by the prevailing wind. Basically this means that areas
"downwind" (in this game, "east", or "right") of a mountain will be
dryer, and areas "upwind" of a mountain ("west", or "left") will be
wetter as moisture is trapped to their benefit. You can take advantage
of this phenomenon by having your Formers raise mountains to "dry out"
your downwind opponents or to increase rainfall for your upwind bases.

#SLOWFUNGUS
#xs 300
The thick {Xenofungus} obstructs your unit. It sometimes takes
several turns to enter a Xenofungus square.

#FRACTIONALMOVE

#INEFFICIENCY
#xs 440
Notice the red tiles on the {energy} bar. That means this base is
losing a lot of energy to {inefficiency}.
Inefficiency increases when your social engineering choices are

You should pick a relatively safe base and instruct it to build
a new {Headquarters} facility.

#SUPPORT
