DisableOpeningMovie=1

; When in windowed mode, always minimise game window when not activated.
auto_minimise=0

; Set how often the game creates (in turns) new autosave files in saves/auto folder.
; These files are overwritten only when the turn is played again.
; Set to 0 to use the older default autosave naming scheme.
autosave_interval=1

; Show additional base details on the base resource window.
; Draw colored labels on headquarters/golden age bases on the world map.
render_base_info=1

; Always show faction-colored label next to foreign probe team units.

; Show a warning dialog when the former action would replace an existing tile improvement.
warn_on_former_replace=1

; Show all treaty changes between foreign factions in a popup message dialog
; instead of the message log where they would disappear after a couple of seconds.
; Also when probes are evicted from territory, this will display it in a separate popup.
foreign_treaty_popup=1

; Improved base name generator that avoids duplicate names across all bases.
; In addition to the faction file, it uses names from basenames/faction.txt.
; If faction names are all used, creates variations from basenames/generic.txt.
new_base_names=1

; Improved prototype name generator for all unit types.
new_unit_names=1

; Enable smooth scrolling on screen edges and other GUI improvements.
; Should be disabled if this feature affects performance too much.
; This feature and PRACX cannot be enabled at the same time.
; * Alternatively drag map window by holding the right mouse button.
; * ALT+R shortcut toggles info window update for the map tile under cursor.
smooth_scrolling=0

; Scroll only if the mouse is this close to screen edges (recommended values 20 .. 100).
scroll_area=40

; When SMAC-in-SMACX mod is enabled, all expansion content is removed from the game.
; Alien Crossfire techs, units, facilities, or abilities will not be available.
; This can also be enabled by a command line parameter "thinker.exe -smac"
; While it is still possible to select alien factions during the game setup,
; it is not supported and may cause glitches.
; The following files must be placed in "smac_mod" folder for smac_only to work:
; alphax.txt, helpx.txt, conceptsx.txt, tutor.txt
smac_only=0

; ****** General AI Settings ******

; Allow Thinker to manage player-owned bases when governor is enabled.
manage_player_bases=1

; Allow Thinker to manage player-owned units when automated.
manage_player_units=1

; Enable Thinker AI for all computer factions up to this slot number.
; Allowed values: 0-7, 0 = disable for all, 7 = enable for all.
factions_enabled=7

; Manage social engineering choices for Thinker factions. Note that depending on
; the bias value improved social_ai might sometimes pick other social models
; than the preferred choice given in the faction definition.
social_ai=1

; Set the amount of priority AI factions have for the preferred social model.
; Allowed values: 0 (no priority) - 1000. By default the priority is moderate.
social_ai_bias=10

; Prioritize former/crawler/resource cap-lifting techs when selecting what to research.
tech_balance=1

; Auto-design special units for all computer factions and upgrade/disband obsolete prototypes.
; This includes improved probe teams, formers, crawlers, battleships and garrison units.
design_units=1

; Maximum amount of satellites of each type AI should attempt to build when available.
max_satellites=20

; Allow AI to spend energy reserves to hurry base production.
; 0 = disable always, 1 = hurry normal facilities and units, 2 = also hurry secret projects.
base_hurry=2

; Minimum allowed distance between adjacent bases. Allowed values: 2-8.
base_spacing=3

; Additional constraint to base_spacing. Discard any locations that have more than
; this amount of bases at the minimum allowed distance. Comment out to disable this check.
base_nearby_limit=3

; Limit how many bases each AI faction should have before they stop colony pod
; production entirely. This expansion limit remains fixed for all map sizes.
; Global base limit imposed by the game engine will always be 512 bases.
expansion_limit=50

; This option scales the base limit to match the player base count if it is larger
; than current expansion_limit. Otherwise expansion_limit value is used instead.
expansion_autoscale=1

; When current difficulty level is below this value the AI factions can't start a secret project
; until the player has its prerequisite tech, even if the AIs already have the same tech.
; Allowed values: 0-6, 0 = allow always, 3 = original default, 6 = apply limit on all levels.
limit_project_start=3

; ****** Game Rules Changes ******
; *** These apply to all factions regardless of factions_enabled setting. ***

; Set AI cost factors for nutrient/mineral production for each difficulty level respectively.
; All difficulty levels must be listed separated by commas from Citizen to Transcend level.
; Original defaults: cost_factor=13,12,11,10,8,7
cost_factor=13,12,11,10,8,7

; In original game mechanics, if the player faction is ranked first, then the AIs
; will get additional growth/industry bonuses. If this simple cost factor is enabled,
; AIs will always use the cost factors set above regardless of the player ranking.
simple_cost_factor=0

; Improved tech cost mechanic to increase late game research costs (see Details.md)
; Tech costs scale relative to the level of current research target, instead of the
; old version where costs increased according to the amount of techs a faction had.
revised_tech_cost=1

; When revised_tech_cost is enabled, this factor is applied on AI research costs.
; Example: 100 = 100% of human cost, 76 = 76% of human cost.
tech_cost_factor=124,116,108,100,84,76

; When revised_tech_cost and Tech Stagnation options are enabled, multiply all
; tech costs by this percentage. Original default is 150.
tech_stagnate_rate=200

; Set the number of content base population for player/AI factions for each difficulty level.
; Any additional population after this number will be drones unless this is modified by
; psych-related effects or faction abilities. Only non-negative values are allowed.
; Original defaults: content_pop_player=6,5,4,3,2,1 and content_pop_computer=3,3,3,3,3,3
content_pop_player=6,5,4,3,2,1
content_pop_computer=3,3,3,3,3,3

; When enabled, bases that have sufficient drone control facilities available before
; the growth phase can grow without triggering possible drone riots on the same turn.
delay_drone_riots=1

; Select whether to allow nerve stapling during the game.
; 0 = disable for all, 1 = enable for AIs only, 2 = enable for all.
nerve_staple=2

; When current SE Police rating is below this value, nerve staple effects expire twice as fast.
; This significantly reduces the incentive to switch social models after stapling bases.
; The game always disallows additional nerve stapling when SE Police < 0.
nerve_staple_mod=0

; When moving non-native units into land fungus squares, always limit the movement cost
; to full speed of the unit. This avoids random waiting when trying to enter fungus tiles.
fast_fungus_movement=1

; Adjust the movement speed on magtubes compared to regular roads.
; For example magtube_movement_rate=2 enables twice as fast movement than on roads.
; Setting this to 0 allows zero cost for magtube movement (original default).
; Values greater than 3 may result in limited maximum speeds when used with high-speed units.
magtube_movement_rate=0

; Adjust how many movement points Choppers will expend upon every attack.
; The original game allows one attack for every available movement point.
chopper_attack_rate=2

; Allow reactivating skipped units on the same turn if they have not spent any movement points.
activate_skipped_units=1

; Probe team infiltration on other factions can expire after a time period when this is enabled.
; When infiltration is discovered and removed, a dialog box will be displayed for both factions.
counter_espionage=1

; Make the combat calculation ignore reactor power and treat every unit as having
; a fission reactor. More advanced reactors still provide their usual cost discounts.
; Planet busters are unaffected by this feature.
ignore_reactor_power=1

; Combat ships are always able to do artillery strikes. When Heavy Artillery is added
; as an optional special ability on ships, the range increases by this many tiles.
; This option is ignored when network multiplayer is active. Allowed values: 0-8.
long_range_artillery=2

; Modifies unit upgrades such that the cost is determined by the mineral row cost difference
; between the two prototypes while crawlers are twice as expensive to upgrade.
; In addition the upgrade cost is at least 10 credits for each mineral row in the new unit.
modify_upgrade_cost=1

; Modifies which additional unit types require mineral support.
; 0 = original defaults, 1 = crawlers need support, 2 = probe teams and crawlers need support.
modify_unit_support=0

; Set free unit support bonus for each AI base in addition to SE modifiers.
; All difficulty levels must be listed separated by commas from Citizen to Transcend level.
unit_support_bonus=0,0,0,0,1,1

; Increases active unit limit from 2048 to 8192. Note that any savegames
; cannot be opened by the original game once the active unit count exceeds 2048.
; Allowed values: 0-1, default=0
modify_unit_limit=1

; Modifies how territory borders are drawn on the map. In original game mechanics, tiles
; that are equidistant between two different faction bases are claimed by the newest base.
; This patch makes the oldest base always claim those tiles. Coastal bases also expand
; territory into the ocean in a similar way compared to actual ocean bases.
territory_border_fix=1

; Automatically relocate lost headquarters to another suitable base.
; This replaces previous event ESCAPED and does not require credits.
auto_relocate_hq=1

; Normally hurrying base production will cost double if the accumulated minerals are
; less than the "Retool exemption" set in alphax.txt. This patch removes the penalty.
; It's recommended to leave this enabled if the exemption value is raised.
simple_hurry_cost=1

; In original game mechanics, eco damage on AI bases is notably reduced from player levels.
; This increases eco damage on AI bases to the same level as the player bases have.
; In addition, constructing Tree Farms and similar facilities always increases the clean
; minerals limit even before the first fungal pop. If Quantum Converter is built or provided
; by the secret project, eco damage is reduced. Nanoreplicator does not reduce eco damage anymore.
eco_damage_fix=1

; Amount of minerals a base can produce before experiencing eco damage. This limit is also
; increased by one after each fungal pop or after building any of these facilities:
; Tree Farm, Hybrid Forest, Centauri Preserve, Temple of Planet.
; Allowed values: 0-1000, default=16
clean_minerals=16

; Set Biology Lab research bonus value.

; Select if secret projects that are destroyed can be rebuilt at other bases.
; Allowed values: 0-1, default=0
rebuild_secret_projects=0

; Select if the planet should randomly spawn spore launchers and other expansion-only units.

; Does not affect any starting units defined for the faction, e.g. Progenitors.
spawn_spore_launchers=1

spawn_battle_ogres=1

; Fungal Tower abundance can also be modified with new_world_builder.
; Spawning frequency is inverse of this number, note that low numbers may break faction spawns.
; Allowed values: 0-1024, always disable=0, original default=40
spawn_fungal_towers=40

; Enable a feature where the player receives extra energy credits after attacking native units.
; Allowed values: always disable=0, reduced credits income=1, original default=2
planetpearls=1

; Select if the game should allow raising land altitude level beyond the previous 3500m limit.
; Increased limit is 4500m and this affects solar collector output and some combat modifiers.
; Allowed values: 0-1, default=0
modify_altitude_limit=1

; Production limits for nutrient/mineral/energy resources on each tile before
; the appropriate tech listed in alphax.txt is discovered by the faction.
; Original defaults: tile_output_limit=2,2,2
tile_output_limit=2,2,2

; Allowed values: 0-10, default=0
soil_improve_value=0

; Enable AQUATIC faction bonus minerals for sea tiles.
; Allowed values: 0-1, default=1

native_lifecycle_levels=40,80,120,160,200,240

; Talent modifiers for facilities and projects. First number sets the modifier type
; (0 = psych type bonus, 1 = always increase talents). Next three numbers are

; Original defaults: facility_talent_value=0,2,1,2
facility_talent_value=1,2,1,1
