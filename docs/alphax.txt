; RESOURCE INFORMATION
;
; Resource production (nutrient, minerals, energy, <unused>) for
; special squares. In land squares, these values are determined
; by the temperature, rainfall, rockiness, etc. of the square.
;
; "Bonus Square" value for particular category is added to other
; production in a square.
;
; "Improved Land" means farm, mine, solar
; "Improved Sea"  means kelp farm, mining platfrom, tidal harness
